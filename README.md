# target-finder

Thanks to Matan Dobrushin for coming up with the project idea. This wouldn't have been possible without his teachings and guidance.

TO DO:
- add test to see if targets return http status code of 200? can implement this as an option
- Entrust or APIs instead of crt.sh?
- Download crt.sh database and update every 6 hours
- MIT License?

FUTURE:
- connect to crt.sh db using postgresql? https://groups.google.com/g/crtsh/c/oEDOzwr2Fuc
- replace crt.sh db with entrust? https://ui.ctsearch.entrust.com/ui/ctsearchui
- Add HackerOne and other bug bounty program databases
- gather in scope targets using Bugcrowd APIs?
