# target-finder

Thanks to Matan Dobrushin for coming up with the project idea. This wouldn't have been possible without his teachings and guidance.

TO DO:
- add test to see if targets return http status code of 200? can implement this as an option
- Entrust or APIs instead of crt.sh?
- Download crt.sh database and update every 6 hours
- MIT License?

FUTURE:
- Add HackerOne and other bug bounty program databases
- source for bugbounty db is not updated fast enough (i.e. gap.com is not there). gather in scope targets using APIs?
