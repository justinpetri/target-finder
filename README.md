# target-finder

# TO DO:
# Trello.com is in bugcrowd and in scope but targets from scan don't pass check because not *.trello.com, bounty program is just trello.com so should we assume anything in domain is automatically in-scope?
# add test to see if targets return http status code of 200? can implement this as an option
# Entrust or APIs instead of crt.sh?

# Add HackerOne and other bug bounty program databases
# gather in scope targets using APIs?

# bugbounty db is not updated fast enough (i.e. gap.com is not there)


# should we scan the Common Names instead of the Matching Identities?
# run bugcrowd check first domain_query?
