# target-finder

Special thank you to Matan Dobrushin for coming up with the project idea.

TO DO:
- Download crt.sh database and update every 6 hours b/c crt.sh has a tendency to go down often

FUTURE:
- connect to crt.sh db using postgresql? https://groups.google.com/g/crtsh/c/oEDOzwr2Fuc
- replace crt.sh db with entrust? https://ui.ctsearch.entrust.com/ui/ctsearchui
- Add HackerOne and other bug bounty program databases
- gather in scope targets using Bugcrowd APIs?
